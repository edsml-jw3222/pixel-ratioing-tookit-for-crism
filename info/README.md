In this directory, you can find `info.json`. It is pre-populated with the data we have on our records. Your responsibility is to **keep it up to date and modify it as soon as anything regarding your IRP changes**. For instance, if you and your supervisor decide to alter the title or there has been a change in your supervisory team, please make those changes in `info.json`. To confirm that your `info.json` was modified correctly, please **ensure the `info` workflow in GitHub Actions is passing** - workflow badge in the table above. Please note that it usually takes some time for the badge status to update. You can check the status of the workflow in `Actions` tab or by refreshing this page after several minutes.
