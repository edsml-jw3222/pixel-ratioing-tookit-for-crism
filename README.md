# Pixel Ratioing Tookit for CRISM

## Introduction

This tool utilizes a machine learning model to predict bland pixels and applies pixel ratioing to reduce spectral noise, with the aim of enhancing spectral features.

## Usage

You can install an environment with all the dependencies with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

Use the following to activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate irp-crism
```

## Note

"functions.py" includes the necessary functions.

"tutorial.ipynb" includes instructions on how to use the program.
